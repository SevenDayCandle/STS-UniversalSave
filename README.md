# STS-UniversalSave

## Introduction

This mod makes game settings (sound, input settings, gameplay settings) independent of save slots. This means that these settings will persist even if you change your save slot or delete your save slots.

Note: When first installing this mod, the game settings will be synced with that of the first save slot. If that slot was empty, then a new game settings file will be created for use with this mod. If you unsubscribe from this mod, the universal settings will be used by the first slot.
